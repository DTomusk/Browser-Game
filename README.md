# Browser-Game
Prototyping a 2d platformer game concept. I had intended to make a game in JavaScript just using the html canvas because of its ease of use and the ability to set things up quickly, but the deeper I got into it the more I realised I was trying to do class based object oriented things which is not JS's strong point. I'm planning on redoing this thing in another, more fitting language (like Python or Java), but that shouldn't be hard to get up to speed because I've already done most of the brain work here.
